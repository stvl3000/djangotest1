# djangotest1
This is my first personal github project for testing.

It is currently built based on Django framework, learned and built from scratch. There are only two Hello Django pages for now.
"./polls" temporarily borrowed html codes from Django official home page, and all links redirect back original site.
"./admin" is the included sample page.
This project will be kept continue developing.

Should you have any interest or suggestion, you are more than welcome to keep watching it or informing me.

Thank you.
