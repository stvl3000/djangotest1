# djangotest1
This is my first personal github project for testing.

It is currently built based on Django framework, learned and built from scratch. There are only two Hello Django pages for now.
"./polls" temporarily borrowed html codes from Django official home page, and all links redirect back original site.
"./admin" is the included sample page.
This project will be kept continue developing.

I built a free Red Hat Enterprise Linux server to run this hello world project. Your are more than welcome to visit it at a new URL:
  
  http://ec2-52-207-252-146.compute-1.amazonaws.com/polls/
 
The previous CentOS server was accidentally built on an chargeable virtual manchine, even the RHEL one has double memory since it is an AWS official recommendation. 

Hereby the old URL will become invalide after 21 May permanently. Appology for that.

Should you have any interest or suggestion, you are more than welcome to keep watching it or informing me.

Thank you.
